# Limitations

Some platforms forbid apps from doing some stuff to stop damaging either the ecosystem of their own or for security reasons.

## iOS

Apple forbids any app from installing applications outside from the App Store, so these features are not included.

 - Application data backup
 - Auto-install applications.

## Android

Google and most manufacturers also forbid applications outside from the store (Play Store, App Market etc.), so these features are not included.

 - Application data backup
 - Auto-install applications.

## macOS

We are not probably allowed to edit other apps.

 - Application data backup (unless it's specified).

## Windows, Linux, BSD

No limitation, rather requires permission. Blueway might ask for SUDO/DOAS password or via UAC but might also attempt backups without these.
